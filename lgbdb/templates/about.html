            <h4><b>Recognizing whether vsync is on or off</b></h4>
            <p>
            Run the game with a tool to show current FPS (steam overlay, voglperf, glxosd). If your FPS is higher than your monitor refresh rate (60Hz for most monitors), vsync is definitely off. If your FPS is lower, vsync might be on or off, and there's no foolproof way to tell. Try running the game with lowest graphics settings and lowest resolution, that should considerable increase your FPS. If your FPS is still way under your monitor refresh rate, your hardware is probably slow. You can try toggling vsync on and off according to the guide below to see whether it has any effect. If your FPS seems to be exactly your monitor refresh rate (i.e. hovers between 59-61 FPS all the time, with a common monitor), vsync is most probably on, or the game is FPS-locked (the framerate won't exceed your monitor refresh rate, even with disabled vsync).
            </p>

            <h4><b>Disabling vsync</b></h4>
            <p>
            <li>See the previous section for instructions on how to recognize whether vsync is on or off.</li>
            <li>Many games have an in-game option to toggle vsync. Try it and see whether it makes any difference. For certain combinations of games and drivers, this sometimes has no effect.</li>
            <li>Proprietary drivers come with a configuration tool (AMD or Nvidia configuration center). Use that tool to toggle vsync either globally or for that particular game. Try it and see if it has some effect.</li>
            <li>Open source drivers do not have configuration tools, but you can sometimes disable vsync by running <code>vblank_mode=0</code> game command. You can easily test this with <code>vblank_mode=0 glxgears</code>, you should see <code>ATTENTION: default value of option vblank_mode overridden by environment</code> message and reported FPS way over your monitor refresh rate (hundreds or thousands). You can use this even with Steam, so you can run <code>vblank_mode=0 steam</code> (make sure to exit it first, if it is already running) and all Steam games should now run with vsync disabled. However, this doesn't unfortunately affect all games, so with some of them, you're out of luck.</li>
            <li>If you haven't managed to turn vsync off for a certain game,you can still upload your benchmark, but in this case we strongly encourage you to add a comment about that ("VSync on!") and describe why it was not possible to turn it off.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><h4><b>Install voglperf</b></h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Voglperf is an open-source software developed by Valve, to monitor the performance of Steam games under Linux; it is available at <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/voglperf">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/voglperf</a>.
                You are invited to read the full documentation, available at the voglperf github page, however here is a condensed version (for debian-based Linux systems):<br>
                
                <code>
                sudo apt-get update<br>
                sudo apt-get install git ca-certificates cmake g++ gcc-multilib g++-multilib mesa-common-dev libedit-dev libtinfo-dev libtinfo-dev:i386<br>
                git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/voglperf.git<br>
                cd voglperf<br>
                make voglperf32<br>
                make voglperf64
                </code>
                </li>
                <br>
                note: it is advisable to build both 32 and 64 bit executables because some games might work only with one or the other version; if you see errors in your voglperf terminal such as <b><i>ERROR: Could not retrieve pid of launched game</i></b> you should try the other voglperf build.
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li><h4><b>Benchmark your game with Voglperf</b></h4></li>
            <ul>
            
                <li>in the terminal you can start the voglperf server with:<br>
                    <code>bin/voglperfrun32 (or bin/voglperfrun64)</code>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    point your browser to <code>http://localhost:8081</code> to connect to the voglperf server
                </li>
                    
                <li>in the voglperf console, start your game with<br>
                    <code>game start &lt;steamappid_here&gt;</code><br>
                    every game on Steam has a unique numeric identifier called the App ID. You can obtain it by searching your game in the <a href= "/game_list">Game List</a>, or at <a href="https://steamdb.info/linux/" target="new">https://steamdb.info/linux/</a>. For example <code>game start 250900</code> will start "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"
                </li>
                    
                <li>create a log file: once you reach the point in the game where you want to start your benchmark, type in the terminal<br>
                    <code>logfile start 60</code><br>
                    this will create a log file in /tmp/ with the benchmark data of your game; the number 60 represents for how long, in seconds, the benchmark will run. Take note of the location of this file, it contatins the actual data to be uploaded: the path is displayed in the terminal right after your command, for example <code>Logfile started: /tmp/voglperf.gameid250900.2016_01_25-10_07_31.csv (100 seconds).</code><br>
                    <b>Important: Open Game Benchmarks does not accept benchmarks shorter than 60 seconds</b>

<h1>About</h1>
    In the last few years, there has been a remarkable increase of video games available for Linux; small and big, indies and AAA companies are showing more interest in this Operating System evey day, and today we can enjoy games such as The Witcher 2, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Civilization V on Linux. More and more developers are launching their games on Windows and Linux simultaneously.<br>
    Gaming on Linux has always been present, but the interest that Valve showed in this platform is surely playing an important role in the current rising trend. As of today (January 2016), more than 1500 titles are available on Steam that support Linux.
    With this in mind, the Open Game Benchmarks database was created, with the goals of having a comprehensive resource of game performances on Linux, and providing comparison information between Linux and Windows, as a tool to push developers and porters to provide a comparable performance on the two systems.
    
    
<h1>FAQ</h1>

<ul>
    <li><h4><b>Why are you supporting only Steam games?</b></h4></li>
    I decided to support only Steam games on this website for several reasons:
    <ul>
    <li>Steam has now enough Linux games to constitute a dataset of respectable size, but still of controlled dimensions; if users could all sort of game executable this database could quickly become very noisy.</li>
    <li>all of the "high profile" games for Linux are available on Steam</li>
    <li>I want to provide a resource that is useful to compare game performances between Linux and Windows</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


<ul>        
    <li><h4><b>Are you going to implement feature xyz?</b></h4></li>    
    Possibly; <a href="mailto:admin@opengamebenchmarks.org">drop me an email</a> about that!
</ul> 
    
<ul>       
    <li><h4><b>Is this project open-source?</b></h4></li>
    Yes, it is. The source is entirely available on <a href="https://github.com/wbasile/Open-Game-Benchmarks" target="new">GitHub</a>!
</ul>

<ul>    
    <li><h4><b>I've noticed a bug, where do I report it?</b></h4></li>
    Please, <a href="mailto:admin@opengamebenchmarks.org">write me an email about it</a>; I will be very grateful for your help
